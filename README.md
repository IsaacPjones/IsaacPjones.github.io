## Tech Stack

This website is built using the following technologies:

- **Tailwind CSS** — for utility-first CSS styling
- **React.js** — for building the front-end components and UI
- **Cypress** — for end-to-end testing
- **GitHub Actions** — for continuous integration and automated workflows
- **AWS amplify** — for site deployment and hosting

I chose this stack to keep the project simple and modern, while using tools that are well supported and aligned with current best practices. 
Additionally, I chose this tech stack to reflect the tech stack I will be using with my main project group.
